## Scruper: AI Newsletter Intelligence Dashboard

---

## Session 1 — 2026-02-21

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Protocol 0: All planning files initialized
- [x] Research: Ben's Bites RSS confirmed at `https://bensbites.substack.com/feed`
- [x] Research: The AI Rundown RSS confirmed at `https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/2R3C6Bt5wj.xml`
- [x] Research: CORS proxy strategy defined
- [x] gemini.md Constitution written with full data schema
- [x] Architecture SOPs written
- [x] Python scraper `tools/scrape_feeds.py` written
- [x] Dashboard `index.html` written
- [x] CSS Design System `assets/css/style.css` written
- [x] Frontend Logic `assets/js/app.js` written
- [x] RSS Parser `assets/js/feed.js` written

### ✅ Phase 1 Build Complete (Session 1)
- Architecture: 2 SOPs written
- Tools: Python scraper + requirements.txt
- Frontend: index.html + style.css + feed.js + app.js
- **Live test**: Dashboard opened in browser, 20 articles loaded from The AI Rundown
- Ben's Bites showed 0 articles (latest post was 35h ago — outside 24h window, correct behavior)
- Source pills showed "Loaded" green status for both sources

### 🔴 Errors Encountered & Fixed
1. **CORS module error**: ES module import via `file://` protocol blocked by browser
   - **Fix**: Rewrote entire JS as a single IIFE `<script>` tag — no imports needed
   - **Lesson**: Use classic scripts for local file:// apps; ES modules require a server origin
2. **Python not in PATH**: `pip` not found — Python installer likely not in Windows PATH
   - **Mitigation**: All scraping logic was ported to the browser-side JS (XHR + CORS proxy)
   - Python tool still available for server/headless use when Python is installed

### 🧪 Tests Run
- ✅ Browser load test: Dashboard loads, renders skeleton cards, fetches feeds
- ✅ **The AI Rundown RSS**: 20 articles fetched via allorigins.win proxy — LIVE DATA CONFIRMED
- ✅ **Ben's Bites RSS**: Feed fetches successfully; 0 articles in 24h window (correct behavior)
- ✅ Source status pills: Show correct loaded/error states per source
- ✅ Stats bar: Shows "20" for Articles Today, "2" for Sources
- ✅ Tab navigation: Renders correctly
- ✅ Article cards: Title, summary, source badge, time, save button all present

### 📝 Notes
- The AI Rundown's main site domain is `therundown.ai` NOT `theairundown.ai` (DNS failure confirmed)
- Beehiiv template vars (e.g. `{{ first_name }}`) appear in raw RSS content; frontend parser strips them

## Session 2 — 2026-02-21

### ✅ Brand Redesign
- First iteration: light frosted-glass + warm orange — **incorrect**, did not match Glaido brand
- Second iteration: dark obsidian (`#050505`) + lime green (`#D4FF33`) — matches `glaido.com` exactly
- `DesignGuidelines/DesignLogo.png` embedded directly in sidebar (replaced hand-crafted SVG)
- Left sidebar nav layout (from design inspiration image)
- Glassmorphic dark article cards with TOP PICK badge
- 4-stat metrics row + breadcrumb header + source status dots

### ✅ Bug Fixes / Self-Anneal Events
- **SA-03**: Light theme (warm orange) didn't match brand → corrected to dark + lime
- **SA-04**: 24h window too strict for newsletter cadence → expanded to 72h

### ✅ B.L.A.S.T. Compliance Review
- Identified missing SA and T phase documentation
- Identified `gemini.md` / SOP staleness
- Formally documented 8 blocked Protocol 0 questions
- Updated `task_plan.md` with B.L.A.S.T. phase markers and halt flags

### ✅ Phase 1 Cleanup (Completed)
- `gemini.md` updated: 72h window rule, fallback proxy rule, IIFE rule (#9)
- `architecture/01_rss_scraper.md` rewritten for current browser + Python dual implementation
- `architecture/02_dashboard.md` rewritten with current brand, layout, state, nav details
- `stripHtml()` enhanced: strips newsletter boilerplate ("Read Online | Sign Up | Good morning…")
- `assets/js/app.js` marked as legacy stub (SA-01 reference)
- `assets/js/feed.js` marked as legacy stub (SA-01 reference)
- `task_plan.md` and `implementation_plan.md` both approved by user

### ✅ Session 3 — 2026-02-21
- **Mobile First Redesign**: Implemented responsive top bar + sliding drawer sidebar for mobile devices.
- **Branding Consistency**: Rebranded "The AI Rundown" to **"The Rundown AI"** across all UI elements and metadata.
- **Reliability Fix (Vercel)**: Switched to `fetch()` API and implemented a specialized **RSS2JSON** primary service to fix `403 Forbidden` errors on the live site.
- **Background Aesthetics**: Added animated "Shape Landing Hero" background effect to the **Saved** section as requested.
- **Final Deployment**: Successfully published to GitHub and verified on Vercel. 🚀
